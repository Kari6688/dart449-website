            <p>As cities continue to grow and evolve, urban development projects play a vital role in shaping the urban landscape and enhancing the quality of life for residents. One such project that has garnered worldwide attention is the High Line, a public park that runs for 1.45 miles along the west side of Manhattan in New York City. Built on an abandoned elevated railway line, the High Line has become an iconic symbol of urban renewal and sustainability, attracting millions of visitors each year.

            With this project, I wanted to proposed narrative website seeks to use the High Line as a case study to explore the positive impacts of urban development projects in large cities. The website has a landing page followed by 3 sections, each providing different aspects of the High Line and the broader context of urban development projects. The first section will be an About section that offers visitors detailed background information on the High Line, including its history and how it came to be a public park. The section is a timeline that takes the users back in time showcasing how the High Line came to be. The last section is a map featuring the key spots along the High Line.
