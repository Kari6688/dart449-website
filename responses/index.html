            <h1>As we may think by Vannevar Bush</h1>
            <br>
            <p>In light of the end of WW II, this text touches upon the technologies created for the atomic bombs towards the end of the war. What I found interesting is the parallel between the way people work on technologies now and then. This article brings out new ideas and methods form collaborative work. The scientists witnessed that diversity can bring more to the table and working all in one space makes things a lot easier. With the memex machine, Bush undoubtedly influenced the future of computers and the internet itself.
                In contrast to the software and apps we use now, almost everything is designed to be a collaborative experience. In the web and design field, collaboration is now key. Figma for example is a software that thrives on sharing knowledge and resources with the community and working on the projects seamlessly with other people.</p>
